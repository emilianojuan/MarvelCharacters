## How is the app built

### UI

The main UI of the application is a collecction view. This app showcases the use of [UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionviewcompositionallayout) and [UITableViewDiffableDataSource](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitableviewdiffabledatasource), two of the most recent UIKit APIs to work with `UICollectonView`.
It also supports different size classes, but it does not support scenes for iPad or large iPhone.

### Architecture

The app showcases a `MVVM+C` architecture. The C stands for [Coordinator](https://khanlou.com/2015/01/the-coordinator/). It showcases a layered architecture to encapsulate data management using DDD concepts. It uses (Combine)[https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine] for async work and bindings. Unit tests and UI tests where added to test every layer of the application.


### Data

The data of the characters is taken from [Marvel's API](https://developer.marvel.com)
